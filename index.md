# Big Data for Engineers

Big Data for Engineers targets a very broad audience in all other departments at the BSc, MSc and PhD level. The material is very similar, but spending more time explaining CS prerequisites. Some programming knowledge (such as Python) and knowledge of logic and algebra (sets, etc) is assumed.
